The application was created to show current movies playing along with information about the movie. It was created using REACT, which  makes API calls to TheMovieDb and renders the information to the client.

Users have the ability to select "Now Playing, Popular, Top Rated, Upcoming movies and search for a movie.

The search bar allows users to type in an input, the input is stored in a useState and that input is then passed along with the API call which returns the results.
